Chapter 3
=========

This chapter covers the development of proposals by interested contractors in response to a customer’s request for proposal. When the customer decides which contractor to engage to perform the project, the customer and the contractor sign an agreement (contract).

For some projects, there is neither a request for proposal nor an actual proposal; rather, after the need is identified, the project moves right into the planning and performing phases of the project life cycle. Examples include a project that one or two individuals do by themselves, such as remodeling their basement into a family room, or a project carried out by a volunteer group, such as organizing a fundraising event.

-   Building relationships with customers and partners

-   Proposal marketing strategies

-   Decision making to develop a proposal

-   Creating winning proposals

-   The proposal preparation process

-   Elements that may be included in a proposal

1. Real-World Project Management Examples
-----------------------------------------

### Vignette A: Sea Green, Redeveloping for Sustainability

Barangaroo Harbor is a disused area in New South Wales, Australia. Proposals were requested in 2008. Public review of two development proposals took place to incorporate public comment and ideas. The project is expected to be complete in 2020. Parts of the project are expected to open in 2015.

-   To redevelop Barangaroo Harbor in the area of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, would be to remove the dismal disused container wharves of the once bustling harbor front and transform the area into an urban destination.

-   Sustainability was core to the aesthetic and commercial goals in the proposal requirements.

-   A long analysis period was part of the delay from the project start in 2003 to the global call for proposals in 2008.

-   “We are setting a project culture plan dedicated to ensuring that we create a high-performance team from the top down, with all members being inducted into the culture and understanding the project vision, values, and objectives.”

-   Within the proposals were requirements related to finance, risk, design, sustainability, planning and delivery, marketing and promotion, and capability for each of the three aspects of the phased project.

-   To ensure sustainability, in addition to renewable energy adoption the proposals needed to include a workforce participation program to train workers and apprentices on sustainability and sustainable practices.

-   Once a winning proposed solution is visualized and communicated in the written proposal, the project continues to be evaluated and changes are managed.

    -   The proposal is not a final document; it is a continuation of a relationship.

    -   One that began in the pre-RFP stages of a project and lasts through the project completion and follow-up.

As a project manager, you will manage relationships with clients and other stakeholders to understand their needs and provide a solution within your project proposal. Maintain a long-term relationship, even if your organization is not chosen to provide the solution. There may be opportunities in the future to propose another solution.

### Vignette B: Project Proposals Nurture the Next Big Thing

Innovation is necessary to compete in our global economy. Having a process related to project proposal development, review, and evaluation are a must. Innovations that are implemented may require termination if they are limping along. Project proposals for one company are evaluated by their alignment with the company's vision and strategic goals.

-   Projects come in all shapes and sizes.

    -   They range from being completed by a small team internally in an organization to externally by large collaborative groups.

    -   One aspect, innovation, is a must-have if an organization is to remain competitive in a volatile global economy.

-   One company evaluates every project against the organization’s vision statement’s four principles: customer focus, innovation, partnering, and value

    -   Implemented a “bring your own device” policy

    -   Ability to be connected during and after office hours addressed the customer service issues and demonstrated a ROI by eliminating company-provided technology and its costs

-   Implementing innovations is more than coming up with a new idea.

2. Building Relationships with Customers and Partners
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Customers (clients) and partner organizations prefer to work with people they know and trust.

-   Relationships establish the foundation for successful funding and contract opportunities. Relationship-building requires being proactive and engaged. It requires face-to-face contacts; it cannot be done as effectively through e-mail or phone conversations.

-   Relationship-building necessitates being a good listener and a good learner. When you are with clients, ask questions and listen. Make the clients feel good. Empathize with their issues whether they are business or personal.

-   Contact potential clients frequently, and not just when there is an opportunity for funding or just before they will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).During these contacts, don’t focus on discussing potential contract opportunities.

-   After meeting with a client, always express your appreciation and thank them for making the time to meet with you.

-   Establishing and building trust is key to developing effective and successful relationships with clients and partners. One way to foster trust is to be reliable and responsive.

-   Ethical behavior in dealing with clients and partners is also imperative for building trust.

-   The first impression you make on a client is pivotal to developing a continuing and fruitful relationship.

-   Clients want to work with people who can solve problems, not with those who merely identify them. Build credibility based on performance.

-   Always put the client first. Clients want to be confident that any projects they do with the contractor will be successful, will involve a good working relationship with the contractor, and will help the clients achieve their business goals.

-   It is advisable not to rely on having a good relationship with just one individual in a client or partner organization, but rather to build relationships with several key people in a client or partner organization since key individuals may leave and others become more influential.

-   Building effective and successful relationships takes time and work; it doesn’t happen overnight.

3. Pre-RFP/Proposal Marketing
-----------------------------

-   Contractors whose business depends on creating winning proposals in response to business or government RFPs should not wait until formal RFP solicitations are announced by customers before starting to develop proposals.

-   Contractors need to develop relationships with potential customers long before the customers prepare requests for proposal.

-   Contractors should maintain frequent contacts with past customers and current customers and initiate contacts with potential new customers.

-   A contractor who is familiar with a customer’s needs and requirements can prepare a better proposal in response to the customer’s RFP.

-   These pre-RFP or pre-proposal efforts by a contractor are considered marketing or business development and are performed at no cost to the customer.

-   In some cases, the contractor may prepare an unsolicited proposal and present it to the customer.

-   If the customer is confident that the unsolicited proposal will solve the problem at a reasonable cost, the customer may simply negotiate a contract with the contractor to implement the proposal, thus eliminating the preparation of an RFP and the subsequent competitive proposal process.

-   Whether the goal is winning a competitive RFP or obtaining a noncompetitive contract from a customer, a contractor’s pre-RFP/proposal efforts are crucial to establishing the foundation for eventually winning a contract from the customer to perform the project.

4. Decision to Develop a Proposal
---------------------------------

-   The development and preparation of a proposal takes time and can be costly.

-   Contractors interested in submitting a proposal must be realistic about the probability of being selected as the winning contractor.

-   Evaluating whether or not to go forward with the preparation of a proposal is sometimes referred to as the bid/no-bid decision.

-   Some factors a contractor might consider in making a bid/no-bid decision are:

    -   Competition—which other contractors might also submit a proposal?

    -   Risk—is there a risk that the project will be unsuccessful—technically or financially?

    -   Mission—is the proposed project consistent with the contractor’s business mission?

    -   Extension of capabilities—would the proposed project provide the contractor with an opportunity to extend and enhance its capabilities?

    -   Reputation—what is the contractor’s reputation with the customer?

    -   Customer funds—does the customer really have funds available to go forward with the project?

    -   Proposal resources—are appropriate resources available to prepare a quality proposal?

    -   Project resources—are appropriate resources available to perform the project if the contractor is selected as the winner? If a contractor is not sure it has the resources to successfully perform the project, it needs a plan for securing them.

-   Contractors need to be realistic about their ability to prepare proposals and about the probability of winning the contract.

-   Submitting a lot of non-winning proposals in response to RFPs can hurt a contractor’s reputation.

-   Sometimes the hardest thing for a contractor to do is decide to no-bid an RFP.

-   Figure 3.1 shows an example of a Bid/No-Bid Checklist. Ask the students whether they should submit a proposal to Ace. The answer is YES.

5. Creating a Winning Proposal
------------------------------

-   The proposal process is a competitive process, and a proposal is a selling document - not a technical report.

-   In the proposal the contractor must convince the customer that the contractor is the best one to solve the problem.

-   In the proposal the contractor must highlight the unique factors that differentiate it from competing contractors.

-   The contractor’s proposal must emphasize the benefits to the customer.

-   Proposals should be written in a simple, concise manner.

-   Proposals must be specific in addressing the customer’s requirements as laid out in the RFP.

-   Proposals must be realistic in terms of the proposed scope, cost, and schedule, in the eyes of the customer.

6. Proposal Preparation
-----------------------

-   The preparation of a proposal can be a straightforward task performed by one person, or it can be a resource-intensive effort requiring a team of organizations and individuals with various expertise and skills.

-   In large-scale efforts the contractor may designate a proposal manager who coordinates the efforts of the proposal.

-   The proposal schedule must allow time for review and approval by management within the contractor’s organization.

-   Proposals in response to RFPs can be as brief as a few pages or run to hundreds of pages of text and drawings.

-   Customers do not pay contractors to prepare proposals. Contractors absorb such costs as normal marketing costs of doing business.

7. Proposal Contents
--------------------

Proposals are often organized into three sections: technical, management, and cost. The amount of detail the contractor includes will depend on the complexity of the project and the contents of the RFP.

### A. Technical Section

The objective of this section is to convince the customer that the contractor understands the problem or need and can provide the least risky and most beneficial solution. The technical section should contain the following elements:

-   Understanding of the need—the contractor must show the customer that its people thoroughly understand the problem to be solved.

-   Proposed approach or solution—the proposal should describe the approach or methodology the contractor would use in developing the solution.

-   Benefits to the customer—the contractor should state how the proposed solution or approach would benefit the customer and achieve the project’s success criteria or expected outcomes, including cost savings, reduced processing time, reduced inventory, better customer service, reduced errors, improved safety conditions, more timely information, reduced maintenance, etc.

### B. Management Section

The objective of this section is to convince the customer that the contractor can do the proposed work (the project) and achieve the intended results. The management section should contain the following elements:

-   Description of major tasks—the contractor should define the major tasks that will be performed in carrying out the project.

-   Deliverables—the contractor should include a list of all deliverables that will be provided during the project, such as reports, drawings, manuals, and equipment.

-   Project schedule—the contractor should provide a schedule for performing the major tasks required to complete the project. The task schedule can be given in any one of several formats: a list of tasks with their estimated start and completion dates, a Gantt chart, or a network diagram.

-   Project organization—the contractor should describe how the work and resources will be organized to perform the project. An organization chart, résumés of the key people, and a responsibility matrix are often helpful.

-   Related experience—the contractor should provide a list of similar projects it has completed and the dollar value of those contracts.

-   Equipment and facilities—the contractor may want to provide a list of its equipment and special facilities, to convince the customer that it has the necessary resources.

### C. Cost Section

The objective of the cost section of the contractor proposal is to convince the customer that the contractor’s price for the proposed project is realistic and reasonable. This section usually consists of tabulations of the contractor’s estimated costs for such elements as the following:

-   Labor—this covers the estimated costs for the various classifications of people who are expected to work on the project. It might include the estimated hours and hourly rate for each person or classification.

-   Materials—the contractor lists the cost of materials it needs to purchase for the project.

-   Equipment—this covers the cost of equipment that must be purchased to complete the project.

-   Facilities—sometimes the contractor will have to rent special facilities or specialty space for the project team.

-   Subcontractors and consultants—when contractors do not have the expertise or resources to do certain project tasks, they may outsource some of the work to subcontractors or consultants to perform those tasks.

-   Travel—travel includes costs such as airfare, lodging, and meals if trips are required during the project.

-   Documentation—some customers want the contractor to show separately the costs associated with the project documentation deliverables. This would be the cost of printing manuals, drawings, or reports or the cost of producing DVDs.

-   Overhead—contractors will add a percentage to costs in items 1 through 6 to cover indirect costs of doing business, such as insurance, depreciation, accounting, general management, marketing, and human resources.

-   Escalation—for large projects that are expected to take several years to complete, the contractor needs to include the costs of escalation in wage rates and materials costs over the length of the project.

-   Reserve—the reserve (also referred to as contingency reserve or management reserve) is an amount the contractor may want to include to cover unexpected items that have been overlooked.

-   Fee or profit—Items 1 through 10 are costs. The contractor must now add an amount for its fee or profit. The total cost plus the profit is the contractor’s price for the proposed project.

Cost estimates should be reasonable and realistic. If possible, it is good practice to have the persons who will be responsible for each of the major work tasks estimate the associated costs.

8. Pricing Considerations
-------------------------

-   When contractors prepare a proposal, they are generally competing with other contractors to win a contract.

-   They need to be careful not to overprice the proposed project, or else the customer may select a lower-priced contractor.

-   They must be equally careful not to underprice the proposed project; otherwise, they may lose money.

-   The contractor must consider the following items when determining the price for the proposed project:

    -   Reliability of the cost estimates—the contractor should be confident that the total cost for the proposed project is complete and accurate

    -   Risk—if the proposed project includes an endeavor that has not been undertaken before, it may be necessary to include a large amount of contingency reserve funds to cover unforeseen risks.

    -   Value of the project to the contractor—there may be situations in which the contractor is willing to live with a tight or low price, for example, in order to win a contract so it won’t have lay off workers.

    -   Customer’s budget—a proposal should not exceed what the customer has available.

    -   Competition—if many contractors are expected to submit bids, it may be necessary to submit a price that includes only a small profit to increase the chances of winning the contract.

9. Simplified Project Proposal
------------------------------

Sometimes a proposal is complex for a large multi-million dollar project. At other times, the proposal may not need to be complex and a simplified or basic proposal may be appropriate and sufficient. Such a basic proposal should include the following elements as a minimum:

1.  Statement of the customer's need—clearly describe the contractor's understanding of the customer's need or problem and reference any information or data to support the need.

2.  Assumptions—state any assumptions that may affect the contractor’s scope, schedule, or price

3.  Project scope—describe the contractor’s approach to addressing the customer’s need or solving the problem, define specifically what major tasks the contractor proposes to do, and outline how the contractor expects the customer to be involved throughout the project.

4.  Deliverables—list all the tangible products or items the contractor will provide to the customer during the performance of the project.

5.  Resources—identify types of expertise and skills the contractor will utilize on the project, including any key subcontractors, consultants, or suppliers.

6.  Schedule—list key milestones with their target dates or cycle time from the start of the project, in sufficient detail to demonstrate a well-thought-out plan.

7.  Price—indicate the bottom-line price to perform the project, with an emphasis in the explanation on the value provided and not on how low the price is.

8.  Risks—point out any risks that have a high likelihood of occurrence or a high degree of potential impact, and show that the contractor has experience and a realistic approach to the project.

9.  Expected benefits—pull together information from the preceding sections and make a case to justify the value of the proposal in terms of expected quantitative benefits, such as return on investment, payback, cost savings, an increase in productivity, reduced processing times, faster time-to-market, and so on.

The focus of the proposal should be on quality of the content—clear, concise, and convincing—rather than quantity or number of pages. Simplified project proposals are usually under 20 pages, and many range from 4 to 8 pages. It is appropriate to attach appendices for items such as résumés of key people who will be assigned to the project, back-up details for cost estimates, or a list of past related projects and associated references.

10. Proposal Submission and Follow-Up
-------------------------------------

-   Proposals should be submitted on time, in the manner specified. Late or incomplete proposals are often not accepted.

-   Depending on the dollar value of the proposal, some contractors will hand-deliver it or send two sets of proposals by different express services.

-   Contractors must continue to be proactive even after they have submitted the proposal. Any follow-up needs to be done in a professional manner and in accordance with the RFP guidelines.

11. Customer Evaluation of Proposals
------------------------------------

-   Customers evaluate contractors’ proposals in many different ways.

    -   Some customers first look at the prices and select only the three lowest-priced proposals for further evaluation.

    -   Other customers screen out those proposals with prices above their budget or those whose technical section doesn’t meet all the requirements.

    -   Other customers, especially on large projects, create a proposal review team that uses a scorecard to rate each proposal. Figure 3.2 depicts a proposal evaluation scorecard. Have the students review the proposal evaluation scorecard and suggest what could be done to raise the scores for the proposal submission.

-   Some criteria customers might use in evaluating contractor proposals include:

    -   Compliance with the customer's statement of work

    -   An understanding of the customer’s problem or need

    -   Soundness and practicality of the proposed approach to solving the problem

    -   Contractor’s experience and success with similar projects

    -   The experience of key individuals

    -   Management capability, including the contractor’s ability to plan and control the project

    -   Realism of the contractor’s schedule

    -   Price—customers are concerned about the reasonableness, realism, and completeness of the contractor’s costs. Did the contractor use sound cost-estimating methodology? Are the labor hours, classifications, and rates appropriate for the type of project? Were any items left out? The customer wants to be sure a contractor isn’t “low-balling” the price to win the contract.

-   After an initial evaluation, the customer may also ask a few contractors to submit a best and final offer (BAFO). This gives the contractor one last chance to reduce its price and possibly win the contract. However, the customer usually requires the contractor to provide a written rationale for any cost reductions to make sure they are reasonable.

-   Once the customer has selected the winning contractor, the contractor is informed that it is the winner, subject to successful negotiation of a contract.

12. Contracts
-------------

Just because the contractor has been selected as the winner does not mean it can start doing the work. Before the project can proceed, a contract must be signed between the customer and the contractor.

-   A contract is a vehicle for establishing good customer-contractor communications and arriving at a mutual understanding and clear expectations to ensure project success.

-   It is an agreement between the contractor, who agrees to provide a product or service (deliverables), and the customer, who agrees to pay the contractor a certain amount in return.

-   The contract must clearly spell out the deliverables the contractor is expected to provide.

-   There are basically two types of contracts: fixed price and cost reimbursement.

### A. Fixed Price Contracts

In a fixed-price contract, the customer and the contractor agree on a price for the proposed work.

-   The price remains fixed unless the customer and contractor agree on changes.

-   This type of contract provides low risk for the customer, since it will not pay more than the fixed price.

-   This type of contract is high risk for the contractor, because if the cost of completing the project is higher than originally planned, the contractor will make a lower profit than anticipated or may even lose money.

-   Fixed-price contracts are most appropriate for projects that are well defined and entail little risk.

### B. Cost-Reimbursement Contracts

In a cost-reimbursement contract, the customer agrees to pay the contractor for all actual costs (labor, materials, and so forth), regardless of amount, plus some agreed-upon profit.

-   This type of contract provides high risk for the customer, since contractor costs can overrun the proposed price.

-   In cost-reimbursement contracts, the customer usually requires that, throughout the project, the contractor regularly compare actual expenditures with the proposed budget and reforecast cost-at-completion.

-   This type of contract is low risk for the contractor, because the customer will reimburse all costs. The contractor cannot lose money on this type of contract.

-   Cost-reimbursement contracts are most appropriate for projects that involve risk.

### C. Contract Terms and Conditions

The following are some miscellaneous provisions that may be included in project contracts:

-   Misrepresentation of costs—states that it is illegal for the contractor to overstate the hours or costs expended on the project.

-   Notice of cost overruns or schedule delays—outlines the circumstances under which the contractor must notify the customer any schedule delays.

-   Approval of subcontractor—indicates when the contractor needs to obtain approval before hiring a subcontractor.

-   Customer-furnished equipment or information—lists the items that the customer will provide to the contractor throughout the project and the dates by which the customer will make these items available.

-   Patents—covers ownership of patents that may result from conducting the project.

-   Disclosure of proprietary information—prohibits one party from disclosing project confidential information, technologies, or processes.

-   International considerations—specifies accommodations that must be made for customers from other countries.

-   Termination—states the conditions under which the customer can terminate the contract, such as nonperformance by the contractor.

-   Terms of payment—addresses the basis on which the customer will make payments to the contractor.

-   Bonus/penalty payments—states that the customer will pay the contractor a bonus if the project is completed ahead of schedule or exceeds other customer performance requirements. Some contracts include a penalty provision, whereby the customer can reduce the final payment to the contractor if the project is not completed on schedule or if performance requirements are not met.

-   Changes—covers the procedure for proposing, approving, and implementing changes to the project scope or schedule.

### D. Measuring Proposal Success

-   Contractors measure the success of their proposal efforts by the number of times their proposals are selected by customers and/or by the total dollar value of their proposals that are selected.

    -   Win ratio—the number of proposals a contractor won compared to the total number of proposals the contractor submitted to various customers over a particular time period; gives equal weight to all proposals.

    -   Total dollar value—the total dollar value of proposals the contractor won as a percentage of the total dollar value of all the proposals the contractor submitted to various customers during a specific time period; gives more weight to proposals with larger dollar amounts.

-   Some contractors submit proposals in response to as many RFPs as they can with the hope that they will eventually win their fair share. Their philosophy is that if they don’t submit a proposal, they don’t have any chance to win, but by submitting more proposals, they increase their chances of winning more contracts.

-   Other contractors are more selective in submitting proposals; they respond to only those RFPs where they think they have a better than average chance of winning the contract. These contractors seriously consider the bid/no-bid decision process in responding to RFPs and submit fewer proposals but attempt to have a high win ratio.

14. Critical Success Factors
----------------------------

-   Customers and partner organizations prefer to work with people they know and trust. Relationships establish the foundation for successful funding and contract opportunities.

-   Establishing and building trust is key to developing effective and successful relationships with clients and partners.

-   The first impression the contractor makes on a client is pivotal to developing a continuing and fruitful relationship.

-   Pre-RFP/proposal efforts are crucial to establishing the foundation for eventually winning a contract from the customer.

-   Do not wait until customers announce formal RFP solicitations before starting to develop proposals. Rather, develop relationships with potential customers long before they prepare their RFPs.

-   Working closely with a potential customer puts a contractor in a better position to be selected as the winning contractor. Learn as much as possible about the customer’s needs, problems, and decision-making process during the pre-RFP/proposal marketing.

-   Becoming familiar with the customer’s needs, requirements, and expectations will help in preparing a more clearly focused proposal.

-   Be realistic about the ability to prepare a quality proposal and about the probability of winning the contract. It is not enough just to prepare a proposal; rather, the proposal must be of sufficient quality to have a chance of winning.

-   A proposal is a selling document, not a technical report. It should be written in a simple, concise manner and should use terminology with which the customer is familiar.

-   The proposal should highlight the unique factors that differentiate it from competitors’ proposals.

-   Proposals must be realistic. Proposals that promise too much or are overly optimistic may make customers skeptical and raise doubt about whether the contractor understands what needs to be done or how to do it.

-   When bidding on a fixed-price project, the contractor must develop accurate and complete cost estimates and include sufficient reserves.

15. Summary
-----------

-   Interested contractors develop proposals in response to a customer’s request for proposal.

-   Relationships establish the foundation for successful funding and contract opportunities. Relationship building requires being proactive and engaged.

-   Contractors should develop relationships with potential customers long before customers prepare a request for proposal.

-   Because the development and preparation of a proposal take time and money, contractors interested in submitting a proposal in response to an RFP must be realistic about the probability of being selected as the winning contractor.

-   It is important to remember that the proposal process is competitive and that the proposal is a selling document that should be written in a simple, concise manner. In the proposal, the contractor must highlight the unique factors that differentiate it from competing contractors.

-   Proposals are often organized into three sections: technical, management, and cost.

-   Customers evaluate contractors’ proposals in many different ways.

-   Once the customer has selected the winning contractor, the contractor is informed that it is the winner, subject to successful negotiation of a contract: fixed-price and cost reimbursement.
